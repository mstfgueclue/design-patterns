# Objective:
Apply design patterns to enhance the structure and flexibility of a software system. 
Choose appropriate design patterns to address specific challenges in a given scenario.

# Scenario:
You are tasked with designing a system for an online bookstore. 
The bookstore needs to manage books, customers, and orders. 
Additionally, the system should provide a way to generate reports on sales and customer activities. 
You are required to apply design patterns to ensure a modular, extensible, and maintainable solution.

# Requirements:
## Book Management:
Implement a way to add, remove, and update book information.
Apply a design pattern to encapsulate the book management functionalities, considering potential future extensions (e.g., different types of books).

## Customer Management:
Design a mechanism for managing customer information.
Use a design pattern to ensure that the customer management module can be easily extended to accommodate different types of customers.

## Order Processing:
Implement a system for processing customer orders.
Apply a design pattern to handle the complexity of order processing and support various types of orders (e.g., bulk orders, regular orders).

## Reporting:
Create a reporting module to generate sales and customer activity reports.
Utilize a design pattern to enable the dynamic generation of different types of reports without modifying the existing code.

## Testing:
Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your design.
Utilize testing frameworks available in Java or .NET.

## Instructions:
Choose at least three design patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns or other relevant patterns for the given scenario.
Apply the chosen design patterns to the corresponding modules in your system.
Provide a rationale for your design choices, explaining how each design pattern improves the flexibility, maintainability, or extensibility of the system.
Implement sample functionalities for book management, customer management, order processing, and reporting using Java or .NET.
Develop unit tests to validate the correctness of your design and the functionality of the implemented modules.

## Deliverables:
Java or .NET project containing the implemented system with applied design patterns.

## A report (document or presentation) explaining:
Chosen design patterns and their application in the system.
Rationale behind each design pattern choice.
Code snippets illustrating the application of design patterns.
Results of unit tests and any observations or improvements.
Note: Keep your system as simple as possible. This exercise is designed to reinforce the understanding and practical application of design patterns in a real-world scenario. Do not implement extended functionalities like Frontends, etc. Keep your system clean (and simple!). F.e. a terminal application is totally fine!
